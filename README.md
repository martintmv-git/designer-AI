# Interior Designer AI
#### - - - Project In Development - - -
This system allows customers to take a picture of their interior space and upload it to the platform through a user-friendly interface. Using artificial intelligence, it calculates the dimensions and other necessary parameters of the space, providing photo gallery of furniture options for the customer to choose from. Another AI system, using convolutional neural networks and image processing, takes the customer's preferred furniture choices and arranges them within the interior image provided by the customer. </br> </br>
The customer can then view a final image with the selected furniture placed in their interior space. Our target audience are people who want to build or re-arrange their living spaces, apartments, houses or offices.
